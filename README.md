This module has been developed to help IT Staff with their Asterisk-Cisco infrastructure deployment,
providing easy provisioning and management of Cisco IP phones and extensions in a similar way to Cisco CallManager.
The idea of creating a module is borrowed from (https://github.com/Cynjut/SCCP_Manager), and was further developed and managed
by PhantomVl (https://github.com/PhantomVl/sccp_manager) who has been unavailable for some time. sccp_manager relies heavily
on chan-sccp, so having the same repository will help improve integration.

SCCP Manager is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.

This module will suit you if you are planing the to migrate from CallManager to Asterisk (or have already done it). SCCP-Manager allows you to administer
SCCP extensions and a wide range of Cisco phone types (including IP Communicator).
You can control phone buttons (depending on the phone model) assigning multiple lines, speeddials and BLFâ€™s.
And you can use the driver functions "sccp_chain" from the GUI module.

### Requirements
- Chan_SCCP module 4.3.4 (or later) channel driver for Asterisk: [See our WIKI](https://github.com/chan-sccp/chan-sccp/wiki/Building-and-Installation-Guide)
  - sccp_manager expects these configure flags to be set during compilation:
    ```./configure  --enable-conference --enable-advanced-functions --enable-distributed-devicestate --enable-video```
  - Creating mysql DB from sorce
    ```mysql -u root asterisk < mysql-v5_enum.sql```

- TFTP Server running under (recommended) /tftpboot/ [See our WIKI] (https://github.com/chan-sccp/chan-sccp/wiki/setup-tftp-service)
  - You will need the phone settings templates. You can use the templates taken from the distribution "chan-sccp"
    ```cp /usr/src/chan-sccp/conf/tftp/\*.xml\* /tftpboot/templates/```

### Module update to latest state

If you installed sccp_manager using git clone instead of installing a zip
file / tarball then you can do easily keep up with the latest develop by
doing this:

1. Goto to module into your local system. (/var/www/html/admin/modules/sccp_manager/)

>        cd /var/www/html/admin/modules/sccp_manager/
>        git pull
>        git checkout develop

### IMPORTANT NOTES:
- !!! If something stops working, use the develop branch [develop](https://github.com/chan-sccp/sccp_manager/tree/develop)
- This system assumes/requires that you are using the Asterisk realtime database. If you are not yet using the realtime database,
you will have to set it up for this module to work ([See](https://github.com/chan-sccp/chan-sccp/wiki/Realtime-Configuration)).
- For the cisco phones to work correctly, they should be provisioned with the latest firmware (v8.1 or higher)
- You can use cisco language profiles (localization) to switch the phones to your locale.
